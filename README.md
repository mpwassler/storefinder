Future blog post demo project

The project is a general purpose store finder with a map, but the demo uses the murals painted on buildings around Cincinnati. So it probably isn't as cool if you use an address from like San Diego or something.

Some good sample addresses from around Cincinnati to try.

- rhinegeist brewery - 1910 Elm St, Cincinnati, OH 45202
